<p>Our team is comprised of Monse Hernandez Bucio, Jose Diaz, and Brian Huynh. All of us are currently attending California State University, Monterey Bay pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. In my spare time, I enjoy reading young adult fiction, hiking and playing air hockey. Recently, I have taken interest in the development of Artificial Intelligence applications that include autonomous cars and planes. In these problem domains, accidents are bound to occur. About a month ago, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/29/11134344/google-self-driving-car-crash-report">Google</a> reported its first accident in which its driverless car was at fault.
<p>
This event could lead to ask whether the Software engineers should be held responsible for any incidents. As soon to be Software Engineers, it is important to explore the repercussions one could face in the event of an incident happening with a product one of us designed. Although, at most software development companies, a series of test cases must be passed before a product is shipped. However, when the product operates in the real world and interacts with humans, it is impossible to develop enough test cases to cover every edge case. Lets look at the personal and societal values at stake in this topic.
</p>
<p>
Some personal values at stake are no Software engineers caused this issue had malicious intent, the software passed all automated test cases and people within the organization had done additional testing before the product was shipped. Societal values include being responsible for the trust the customer has in the company and the technology and having empathy for the customer be present throughout the Software development process.
