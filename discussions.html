	  <p>Below are questions answered by some of our classmates regarding on what side they are on regarding different situations about our essay topic.</p>
<p><strong>1. In this scenario, Windows has recently released a new official software that costs $150 for consumers to buy. However, 
this version of Windows is filled with glitches and security flaws that make that product deemed unfinished by users. 
Should Windows take responsibility and provide their customers with a refund, or should they make a patch and still charge the $150?</strong></p>
</br>
<p><strong>A.C. </strong> I think that the customer should have the option of whether or not they would like a refund but if they get a refund they won’t get access 
to the software anymore, and if Microsoft fixes everything the way it should it should be okay for them to charge the $150.</p>
<p><strong>C.G. </strong>I Microsoft should have a disclaimer saying that really no software is without bugs or security flaws. Unless the bugs are catastrophic or 
the security flaws are major, I think they should not allow for a refund. It is in the nature of software to have some bugs.<p>
<p><strong>M.R. </strong>I think Windows should definitely provide their customers with a refund for those who want the refund. However, for the customers who want 
the patched version then they should not get a refund because they are still going to be using the product afterall.<p>
</br>

<p><strong>2. In the future, when every aspect of our lives are touched by software; the potential negative impact of defective software could cause damage to those
 that use this technology for sustainability purposes. Like we have the FDA for food and drugs, should a similar association be made for software companies?</strong><p>
<p><strong>A.C. </strong>There should be a similar associations like the FDA for software because it will be a big part of our future and that is something that is out
 of our control so policy makers should take the responsibility to protect citizens.<p>
<p><strong>C.G. </strong>Yes, there should be a FDA for software that is used by hardware that we come in contact with on a day to day basis. Self Driving cars should have 
universal guidelines that make them safe for all to manufacture and use.<p>
<p><strong>M.R. </strong>Yes! There definitely needs to be and FDA type organization for software companies. With the rise of wearable technology being used for health 
reasons there definitely needs to be regulation with potential lives at risk.<p>
</br>
<p><strong>3. If there is a car that is being developed, but the product is allowed to be pre purchased, say two years prior the finish date, and the development company 
runs into hiccups. These hiccups prolongs the date two years longer, should the company return some amount of value, or have the users wait without any consequences?</strong><p>
<p><strong>A.C. </strong>Personally as a user I think the company should be held accountable for something like this and there should be some consequences. If the wait
 is too long after the promised date then there should be more serious consequences, say more value returned. However, there’s also the possibility that if the company 
 will have to pay for not finishing a product in time, then they are losing revenue which they won’t like, so they might try to speed up the process which can result in
 a car with bugs.<p>
<p><strong>C.G. </strong>I think it is up to the person who preordered it to make that decision. This happens a lot when it comes to crowdfunding. Sometimes things go bad
 and the company decides to split or they delay the product for a long time. Therefore there needs to be universal rules for these types of things.<p>
<p><strong>M.R. </strong> All the customers that preordered the vehicles need to be notified of what is going on. Similar with the first question, the company should offer 
a full refund for those who want it and do not want or can not wait. The customers that do decide to wait should all get some sort of guarantee that their product will be 
delivered on the specific deadline and there will be no faults. If any customers are not satisfied then they should get a complete refund.<p>
