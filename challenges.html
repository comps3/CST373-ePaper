<p>Having bug free software will be near to impossible to accomplish since there is always room for human error. Bugs were 
started to be seen in 1947, where a Harvard University's Mark II technical team saw a bug in a machine they were working on,
 Relay 70. Since then, there have been a lot of reports that have stated that there are bugs in software. The NSA discloses 
 hundreds of hardware and software bugs a year. Someone who used to work in the NSA says that there were around 300 incidents 
 a year that had to do with software bugs and for each incident it had three to seven bugs reported. Not all software bugs that 
 occur are shared with the public, only the ones that have the greatest impact  or place people in danger.</p>
<p>With the increase of technology since the 1940’s, more projects have been developed and the probability of bugs existing in 
the code is higher. Some bugs can have a small effect such as not letting a user use a service, healthcare.gov website, up to 
killing people with radiaiton or false calculations, NASA’s space rockets. Some bugs may be prevented since engineers have seen 
the errors of others and can use that experience to make their product better. Although some bugs cannot be easily prevented. In 
the case of spaceships, the software cannot be tested with the hardware because of the cost it will take and conditions. Space ships 
follow the waterfall process and engineers have to wait until the end of the project to see how the spaceship will function.</p>
<p>Projects that require the waterfall method and that have never been built, are the ones to seem to contain more bugs. There are 
approximately ten to twenty defects per one-thousand lines of code. It is normal for human error to occur, which is one of the reasons 
software bugs exist, and software complexity increases with all of the new technological advancements that are coming out. These things 
will not stop to exist and will still occur years from now the same way software bugs existed since the 1940’s, unless machines program 
themselves or thousands of dollars are spent to ensure bug free code.</p>
