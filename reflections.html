		<p>This issue comes down to the level of severity in the consequences a user faces due to faulty software. If Chrome (Internet browser) decided to crash just before an assignment was due, I would be tempted to blame the developers but I would also take responsibility for turning in an assignment at the last minute. In ten years when self-driving vehicles become more reliable and in the scenario where I were to be involved in an accident; I would blame the software developers of the vehicle for any injury I would have. Although, I would be sympathetic towards the Software Engineers because it is difficult to write software that can anticipate every possible scenario that can occur in life. Software development tools and methodology will undoubtedly improve as time goes on which will lead to a decrease in software defects. 
		</p>
		<p>After writing this paper, I have gained a greater understanding about an issue that plagues Software Engineers. At the start of this paper, I believed that Software defects were inevitable and Software Engineers are responsible to write good code and perform extensive testing before a product was shipped. However, NASA has already shown that it requires a large amount of resources in order to create near perfect software. In the private industry, software may be unable to be run through the test created by the quality assurance engineers due to the timeline requirement. Luckily, the media has devoted portions of their time to report on serious Software bugs that have the potential to impact people’s lives. 
		</p>
    <p>
    Before writing this paper, I did not actually really think that software engineers should be blamed for any accidents that happen due to bugs. Perhaps, I was bias sense that is the career I chose. After analyzing different incidents that have happened throughout the years, it became more clear to me why software engineers do not have absolute control of the consequences of the code. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In some cases, it is not even that the software developers did not do their job when creating the code, but the fact that the requirements or variables of the situation change. Overall, my opinion in this issue did not change. I still believe that software engineers should no be blamed for incidents that happen as a consequence of bugs.
    </p>
		<p>At the moment, when users have complaints about their software experience they take to their favorite social media platform to discuss their concerns. Instead, they could that the same amount of time to reach out to the company that sold them the software and hold a conversation about how the software defect was triggered. This concept does seem quite similar to the widely regarded technical support experience. Due to the availability of high quality search engines, users will be able to resolve some technical problems without the company’s assistance. Users will be able to report problems related to the inner workings of the program. The incentive for users to participate in such program is due to the inherent reciprocation of good. 
Users have the ability to improve the software experience for all the people who use it.
		</p>
		<p>In the political realm, there are no government entities that oversee problems in the Software industry. As Software continues to consume more aspects of our lives, the government should create an entity similar to the National Highway Traffic System Administration. Its initial duties  could be to hold companies responsible for the damages that users experience through use of their software.
