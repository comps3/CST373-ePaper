<p> Writing bug free code is a nearly impossible task to do, and the attempt to do so requires a tremendous amount of time and money from the companies providing the service or product to be developed. Usually companies have to provide a deadline ahead of time. This puts a lot of pressure on the shoulders of the software developers because they have to work against the clock to meet the deadline. </p>
<p>	On the other hand, software developers should have the skills necessary to meet their deadline with a fully functional bug free code. In addition, the internet and the work of other software developers provide a strong basis of resources the software developers can use in order to do a good job when writing code. </p>
<p>A very recent incident happened in March, 2016, where <a href="http://abc7chicago.com/news/oops-demolition-crew-knocks-down-the-wrong-house-/1266475/">Google Maps</a> had a bug in their code. A demolition company used Google Maps to find the location of a house that was to be demolished. The workers of the company relied on Google Maps and torn down the house indicated by Google. To their surprise, the Google Maps had a bug in their software, and it led the workers to the wrong house. The wrong house was demolished because of a bug in the Google Maps software. </p>
<p>Another incident happened in December, 2014. Amazon uses a system called RepricingExpress to automate the prices of their products. On December 12, 2014 a glitch happened in the ReppricingExpress system and many products sold through Amazon had their prices set to only 1 penny. Mostly third party companies were the ones affected the most. In particular, a company called <a href = "http://www.businessinsider.com/go2games-and-the-amazon-1-penny-pricing-glitch-2014-12?r=UK&IR=T">Go2Games</a> was extremely affected. Overall, they lost about £350,000. Not only where they affected financially. They had been around for about two years and had an outstanding record with their customer feedback. As many of the 1 penny orders were cancelled, the feedback received by their customers turned into a nightmare. All this happend because of a bug in the software of RepricingExpress.</p>
<p>Another software incident happened on October, 2014 in the <a href = "http://www.cips.org/en/Supply-Management/News/2014/October/MPs-1-billion-cost-of-UK-Border-Agency-IT-failures-gobsmackingly-awful/">United Kingdom Border and Immigration system </a>. A bug in the software led to 50,000 asylum requests being rejected without notice. On top of that, out of 250,000 case that needed to be checked, 50,000 of them were gone and they could not find them in their system. The total cost of this incident was about £1 billion, which came from tax money.
</p>
<p>Some of the key players in these cases are the software developers themselves, the owners of the companies of product developed, and the customers and users of that product. The software engineers have the responsibility to develop working code that ideally should be bug free. The owners of the company that provide the product are the image, which means that whenever a bug in the code leads to incidents their reputation gets affected. Lastly, the customers who use the software might lose money or important information when a software malfunctions due to a bug.</p>
<p>Due to the major advancements and improvements in the software engineering  and technology fields, people are more likely to believe that when code with bugs is written, it is should be blamed on the software developers. The logic behind this is that the software developers now have endless resources to help them write perfect code, as opposed to a several decades ago when the software engineering was just starting. </p>
<p>Currently there are not laws regarding who is to blame when a piece of software has bugs and might cause incidents. Making laws about software will be no easy task, however it is clear now that these type of laws will have to be created eventually. </p>
