				<p>Other groups that are concerned with software bugs are Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Anonymous. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/about">EFF</a> is comprised of leading technologist, activists and attorneys whose goal is to protect civil liberties of digital citizens; these include free speech online, unjust surveillance and supporting freedom enhancing technology. The <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/todays-fbi-facts-figures/facts-and-figures-031413.pdf/view">FBI</a> is made of agents, analyst and other professionals whose goal is to protect the United States from domestic terrorism to cyber attacks. Anonymous is a loosely formed group that is comprised of people at different stages of life from kids still going to school to employed software engineers and IT support technicians. There is no leadership structure in Anonymous which allows anyone to express their concerns among the group.  Issues that have gained support from Anons tend to be related to censorship. There have been issues that pertain to race and income that have caused the FBI to change positions on an issue.
				</p>
				<p>While the EFF and Anonymous in recent events have not changed their stance due to ethnicity, income, the FBI has. In the days leading up to the grand jury’s decision on the Michael Brown case, the government entity released a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-warns-ferguson-decision-lead-violence-extremist-protesters/story?id=26980624">bulletin</a> claiming that certain individuals will use the protest to incite and engage in violence. Those people could be armed with bladed weapons, firearms or tactical gear/gas masks. The underlying purpose of the bulletin is to dissuade people from exercising their constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly.  Less than a few years later, the FBI tried to force <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/29/apple-vs-fbi-all-you-need-to-know.html">Apple Inc</a> to create a tool that would bypass their mobile operating system security measures in order to gain access to the gunman’s iPhone in the San Bernardino shooting.  The court asked for “reasonable technical assistance” in the case. This statement was mentioned because Apple has a large amount of engineering talent and financial resources.  However, FBI has not gone after Telegram Messenger, a messaging platform that has been frequently used by terrorist groups such as ISIS. The company is entirely self-funded, so it would not have the resources to break its own encryption algorithm to help the FBI. All of these groups viewpoints are viewed in different ways by the public.
				</p>
				<p>The EFF and Anonymous represent the popular viewpoint while the FBI represents the opposing viewpoint. These parties disagree due to their missions which at times conflict in certain situations. When the FBI wanted Apple’s assistance in defeating the security measures in their mobile operating system, the EFF believed it would violate people’s privacy. A reason why the FBI holds the unfavorable viewpoint is that some of their solutions do not factor in the unintended consequences of their actions on innocent people.  While all of the groups hold differing opinions on a variety of issues, all of them use various platforms on the Internet to share them.</p>
				<p>All of the groups leverage the Internet effectively to communicate their ethical perspectives. Both the FBI and EFF use blogs, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to spread their message. Anonymous has focused on sharing their message on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. While these groups use similar mediums on the Internet to communicate their message; they use different ethical frameworks to establish their positions.
