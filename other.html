				<p>Other groups that are concerned with software bugs are Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), United States Federal Bureau of Investigation and Anonymous. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/about">EFF</a> is comprised of leading technologist, activists and attorneys whose goal is to protect civil liberties in the digital world which includes free speech online, unjust surveillance and supporting freedom enhancing technology. The <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/todays-fbi-facts-figures/facts-and-figures-031413.pdf/view">FBI</a> is made of agents, analyst and other professionals whose goal is to protect the United States from domestic terrorism all the way to cyber attacks. Anonymous is a loosely formed group that is comprised of people at different stages of life from kids still going to school to employed software engineers and IT support technicians. There is no leadership structure in Anonymous which allows anyone to express their concerns among the group.  Issues that have gained support from Anons tend to be related to censorship. There have been issues that pertain to race and income that have caused the FBI to change positions on an issue.
				</p>
				<p>While the EFF and Anonymous in recent events have not changed their stance due to ethnicity, income, the FBI has. In the days leading up to the grand jury’s decision on the Michael Brown case, FBI released a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-warns-ferguson-decision-lead-violence-extremist-protesters/story?id=26980624">bulletin</a> claiming that certain individuals will use the protest to incite and engage in violence. Those people could be armed with bladed weapons, firearms or tactical gear/gas masks. The underlying purpose of the bulletin is to dissuade people from exercising their constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly.  Less than a few years later, the FBI tried to force <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/29/apple-vs-fbi-all-you-need-to-know.html">Apple Inc</a> to create a tool that would bypass their mobile operating system security measures in order to gain access to the gunman’s iPhone in the San Bernardino shooting.  The court asked for “reasonable technical assistance” in the case. This statement was mentioned due to the fact that Apple has large amount of engineering talent and financial resources.  However, FBI has not gone after Telegram Messenger, a messaging platform that has been frequently used by terrorist groups such as ISIS. Although, the company is entirely self-funded, so the company would not have the resources to break its own encryption algorithm to help the FBI. All of these groups viewpoints are viewed in different ways by the public.
				</p>
				<p>The EFF and Anonymous represent the popular viewpoint while the FBI represents the opposing viewpoint. These parties disagree due to their missions which at times conflict in certain situations. When the FBI wanted Apple’s assistance in defeating the security measures in their mobile operating system, the EFF saw that the request had the potential to violate people’s privacy through the development of a master key. A reason why the FBI holds the unfavorable viewpoint is that some of their solutions do not factor in the unintended consequences of their actions on innocent people.  While all of the groups hold differing opinions on a variety of issues, all of them use various mediums on the Internet to share them.</p>
				<p>All of the groups leverage the Internet effectively to communicate their ethical perspectives. Both the FBI and EFF use blogs, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to spread their message. Anonymous has focused on sharing their message on Facebook and numerous Twitter and YouTube accounts. While these groups use similar mediums on the Internet to communicate their message; ethical frameworks are used subconsciously to form the basis of their message.
				</p>
				<p>A typical issue that technology companies encounter when they create a new product is delivering it to the public on time. Companies fret delivering a product after a competitor has already released their own variation. In order to hit the deadlines, teams will remove procedures in the Software development lifecycle that are not pertinent to the release of the product. As a result, the product may not perform exactly as the customer anticipates. My assumption that accompanies my position is that delivering products to market on time is more important than delivering a functional product. Three ethical frameworks will now be used to analyze this issue.
				</p>
				<p>Social Group Relativism has caused a change in my position and assumptions on the issue. The definition of this framework is that proper conduct is understood by what the social group expects of us.  At some companies, there could be an implicit understanding among co-workers that code should not ship unless it has been thoroughly tested. Under this framework, my position has changed because it would be unethical to act in a certain manner that would violate the implicit code of conduct maintained by the social group. My assumption has also changed to always do what is considered right within the company.
				</p>
				<p>Utilitarianism has caused a similar shift in my position and assumptions. The framework dictates that actions should be based on doing the greatest good for the greatest number. At a company like Amazon, their development teams are focused on meeting their customer’s demands. Whenever they try to develop a new product, the team has to write a press release about the product before the logistics of the project are discussed. In a sense, my position has changed in a similar manner compared to the Social Group Relativism framework. Although my assumption differs from that framework before because employees would place higher priority to look after the needs of the customer than conform to the implicit code of conduct among the employees.
				</p>
				<p>Egoism is similar to my initial position and assumption on the issue but it conflicts with Social Group Relativism and Utilitarianism. This framework entails that individuals and business have an obligation to guide their conduct based on a rational calculation of one’s own interest. While Egoism supports my initial position and assumption on the issue, it deviates from the position and assumption mentioned in Social Group Relativism because the company’s interest drives the decisions instead of the company’s employees. Egoism position and assumption also differs from Utilitarianism because a company’s interest may not always be aligned with the customer’s interest.
