        <p>A typical issue that technology companies encounter when they create a new product is delivering it to the public on time. Companies fret delivering a product after a competitor has already released their own variation. In order to hit the deadlines, teams will remove procedures in the Software development lifecycle that are not pertinent to the release of the product. As a result, the product may not perform exactly as the customer anticipates. My assumption that accompanies my position is that delivering products to market on time is more important than delivering a functional product. Three ethical frameworks will now be used to analyze this issue.
        </p>
        <p>Social Group Relativism has caused a change in my position and assumptions on the issue. The definition of this framework is that proper conduct is understood by what the social group expects of us.  At some companies, there could be an implicit understanding among co-workers that code should not ship unless it has been thoroughly tested. Under this framework, my position has changed because it would be unethical to act in a certain manner that would violate the implicit code of conduct maintained by the social group. My assumption has also changed to always do what is considered right within the company.
        </p>
        <p>Utilitarianism has caused a similar shift in my position and assumptions. The framework dictates that actions should be based on doing the greatest good for the greatest number. At a company like Amazon, their development teams are focused on meeting their customer’s demands. Whenever they develop a new product, the team starts by writing a press release about the product before the logistics of the project are discussed. In a sense, my position has changed in a similar manner compared to the Social Group Relativism framework. Although my assumption differs from the previous framework because employees would need to place higher priority on the customer's needs as opposed to conforming to the implicit code of conduct among the employees.
        </p>
        <p>Egoism is similar to my initial position and assumption on the issue but it conflicts with Social Group Relativism and Utilitarianism. This framework entails that individuals and businesses have an obligation to guide their conduct based on a rational calculation of one’s own interest. While Egoism supports my initial position and assumption on the issue, it deviates from the position and assumption mentioned in Social Group Relativism because the company’s interest drives the decisions instead of the company’s employees. Egoism position and assumption also differs from Utilitarianism because a company’s interest may not always be aligned with the customer’s interest.
