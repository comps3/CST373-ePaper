<p>The media is on top of every critical situation that occurs in the world in order to bring it to viewers/readers. In the case of the common issue of software engineers, bugs in software code, media tries to leave the reader/viewer with details of what happened in order for them to come to the conclusion whoâ€™s fault it is. The media is not bias when covering these type of news. Depending on what kind of problem software bugs cause, media can try to alert everyone they can so that less accidents happen. For example, if a <a href = "http://www.tricentis.com/blog/2015/05/05/software-failures-of-2015-quarter-one/"> car</a> is suddenly declared hackable, the media will try to cover the situation in their news broadcast that same night. Depending where the news comes from, there is a certain amount of <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2008/08/17/media-credibility/"> credibility</a> to the story. Most people get their news from watching television, while others from newspapers, radio, and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/new-pew-data-more-americans-are-getting-news-on-facebook-and-twitter/"> social media</a>.</p>
<p> <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2009/03/19/10-historical-software-bugs-with-extreme-consequences/"> There</a> are various historic events caused by software bugs. One case in 1985, involved a medical machine, the Therac-25 medical radiation therapy device. Many people treated by this device received about one hundred times the dose of radiation. At this time media was not as massive and people were not easily alerted of these types of situations. The result of news not being able to travel fast or to every part of the world is the risk of making the same mistake. In Panama city in the year 2000, five or more other people died due to cancer and or illness due to the radiation overdose of a medical machine.</p>
<p>A recent problem where a bug in software caused problems to people is the April fools joke by google. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/1/11350056/google-gmail-mic-drop-joke-april-fools-day-apology"> Google</a> added a button, in its gmail application, next to the regular send button. The additional button, when clicked, sent an email to the recipient with a GIF of a minion dropping a microphone and muted the email thread, not allowing the senders to receive email from the people they sent the GIF too. The problem was that even when people clicked the regular send button, the application would send the minion GIF and mute the email thread. This cost many professional employees their jobs, interviewers a job offer, and misunderstandings. Google later acknowledged that they had a bug in their code, not having safeguards, and apologized to the public. </p>
